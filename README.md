# bindicator

How to use/implement: 
1. Go to [this](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/recycling-organics-garbage/houses/collection-schedule/) website to determine which district you live in. 
2. Select which district you live in on the LCD display.
3. Congrats! Your bindicator is now configured. The LCD should display which day of the week the bins will be collect (T, W, R or F) along with the current date. Click the button to see which bin (garbage, recycling or compost) should be put out (blue = recycling, yellow = garbage, green = compost). 

Limitations: this only works for residential homes under Toronto's daytime collection schedule (this limitation is in place because this is the only data made public by the city of Toronto). Datasets taken from Toronto's [Open Data Catalogue ](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/solid-waste-pickup-schedule/)
